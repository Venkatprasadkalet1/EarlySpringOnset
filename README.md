## Description
The onset of spring is important for the dynamics of the Earth system and a variety of ecological sectors. Understanding changes in the timing and frequency of anomalously early springs will be necessary for evaluating the climate system in response to natural and anthropogenic forcings. We focus on the dynamics and changes in spring onset through historical and future periods using a variety of observational and modeling experiments. Our most recent project uses the CESM Large Ensemble (LENS) project and Extend Spring Indices Model (SI-x) to understand the risk of March 2012-like (earliest spring in observational record) springs through the end of the 21st century. Our findings suggest that the forced warming in response to climate change will make the frequency of March 2012-like springs the new normal by mid century

A Python [Anaconda3 Distribution](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) was used for our analysis. Tools including [CDO](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo) and [NCO](http://nco.sourceforge.net/) were also used for initial data manipulation.
